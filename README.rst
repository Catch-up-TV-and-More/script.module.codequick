============
Introduction
============
Codequick is a framework for kodi add-on's. The goal of this framework is to simplify add-on development.
This is achieved by reducing the amount of boilerplate code to a minimum, automating as many tasks that can be
automated, like route dispatching and sort method selection. Ultimately allowing the developer to focus primarily
on scraping content from websites and passing it to kodi.

This project is mostly done, just need to finish the documentation and upload it to readthedocs.
It has already been added to the official kodi repository.
